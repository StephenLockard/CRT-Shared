# CRT Demo Assets

This is a repository of shared demo assets for Copado Robotic Testing. 


## Details
The main branch contains a common folder with reusable functionality such as library imports and keywords. 

Each branch corresponds to a different test suite, and inherits from main. 

_Main is merge protected to prevent unwanted changes._ 

## Usage
Each of these branches is set up as a test suite and runnable out of the box. 

Follow [this short video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WLTOacWnyJfnyIYqCwlX9SlwFD8kY1O8/view) to set up first time use.
