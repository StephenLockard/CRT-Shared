# CRT Demo Assets

This is a repository of shared demo assets for the CRT team. 


## Details
The main branch contains a common folder with reusable functionality such as library imports and keywords. 

Each branch corresponds to a different test suite, and inherits from main. 

_Main is merge protected to prevent unwanted changes._ 

## Usage
Each of these branches is set up as a test suite and runnable out of the box. 
To do so, sign in with your CRT credentials and go to [this project](https://robotic.copado.com/robots/25489/dashboard).
